Project-04-Python Assignments, Challenges, and Mini Projects

This repository includes a wide range of Python assignments and mini projects completed during my learning journey. The content is thoughtfully divided into beginner to intermediate levels, with each file representing a specific concept, task, or logic-building activity in Python.

These assignments cover the following key areas:

Basic Python Syntax – Understanding variables, data types, input/output, and basic arithmetic operations through tasks like "Add Two Numbers" and "Convert Fahrenheit to Celsius".

Expressions and Operators – Tasks such as calculating energy with E=mc², converting feet to inches, or using the Pythagorean theorem to find triangle sides.

Control Flow (If-Else Conditions) – Smart challenges like leap year detection, age check for voting, and height check for rides.

Loops and Iteration – Practice with for and while loops using projects like Fibonacci series, countdown timers, and pattern-based print programs.

Functions – Exercises like doubling numbers, checking odd/even, printing divisors, and returning multiple values to strengthen code reusability.

Lists and Dictionaries – Fun tasks like manipulating lists, indexing, and building a phonebook using dictionaries for storing key-value pairs.

Logical and Mind Challenges – Projects like guessing games, prime number finders, number patterns, and remainder calculations enhance logic-building skills.

Information Flow – Handling data through returns, range checking, inventory stock checking, and more.

Games and Interactive Projects – These include:

Mad Libs Game

Rock, Paper, Scissors

Guess the Number (User vs Computer & Computer vs User)

Hangman Game

Password Generator

These projects demonstrate my growing confidence in Python, my ability to solve logical problems, and my interest in building interactive tools. Every task helped me understand how to break problems into smaller chunks and convert ideas into working code.

This repository is a reflection of my hands-on learning approach and dedication to mastering the fundamentals of Python programming through real practice, logical reasoning, and creativity.
