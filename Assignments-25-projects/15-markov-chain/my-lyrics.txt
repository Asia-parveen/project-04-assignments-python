I feel alive, I feel alive, I feel so high, rising with the sun.
The moonlight dances on the sea, shimmering in the night.
Life is a journey, full of ups and downs, but I keep going.
In the silence of the night, I hear the music of my heart.
Every step I take, I feel the rhythm of life guiding me forward.
